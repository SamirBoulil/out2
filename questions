// How to test Application layer ? Acceptance then unit or the other way around ?
// Why the commands "AnswerQuestion" has properties of primitive types (string instead of UserId class)
// in test/Acceptance/FeatureContext.php:73 should the command have the userId (even tough: the user is identified by its
// externalId: slackuserId)

- When I test a class like InMemoryQuestionAnsweredEventStoreTest, should I unit test it (tests\Unit\Infrastructure\...) or
is it part of the integration part.

- Seems like classes in Infra / Applications are not unit-tests ? (CF Handlers are not unit tested).
